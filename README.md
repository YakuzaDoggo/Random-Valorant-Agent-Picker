# Random-Valorant-Agent-Picker
What it reads on the tin. I know that the game can pick a random agent for you, but it isn't entirely random since you'll just lock in the agent you hovered over. And that's cringe.

**So why not have a program pick a more random one?**


## Warning
This will only work currently on Windows environments. Sorry Mac and Linux users!

## Installation
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/YakuzaDoggo/Random-Valorant-Agent-Picker/releases), download and run.

## Usage
- Start the program.
- Enter a number of how many players need a random agent.
- The program will do some magic and pick some random agents.
- Chaos ensues.
